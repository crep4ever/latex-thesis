      Different data acquisition devices produce images of several
      gigabytes. Analyzing such large images raises two main
      issues. First, the data volume to process forbids a global image
      analysis, hence a difficult partitioning problem. Second, a
      multi-resolution approach is required to extract global features
      at low resolution. For instance, regarding histological images,
      scanners' accuracy recently improved such that cellular
      structures can be examined on the whole slide. However, produced
      images are up to 18\,GB. Besides, considering a tissue as a
      particular layout of cells is a global information only
      available at low resolution. Thus, these images combine
      multi-scale and multi-resolution information.
      
      In this work, we define a topological and hierarchical model
      which is suitable for the segmentation of large images. Our work
      is based on the previous models of \emph{topological map} and
      \emph{combinatorial pyramid}. We introduce the \emph{tiled map}
      model in order to represent large partitions and a hierarchical
      extension, the \emph{tiled top-down pyramid}, to represent the
      duality between multi-scale and multi-resolution
      information. Finally, we propose an application of our model for
      the segmentation of large images in histology.
